To download and open a SketchUp file, you can use the SketchUp 22+ app on a Windows or Apple device, or access the web app. Simply import the file into the app or web page to begin editing and viewing the 3D model. It's easy and convenient!

You can use the SketchUp app for free here: [Trimble SketchUp Free](https://app.sketchup.com/) (Requires user to sign up)
You can download the Blender app for free (Open source) here: [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/) (Does not require you to register)
